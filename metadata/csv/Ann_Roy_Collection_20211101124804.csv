He talks about the “knower” card.

Recordings likely from a course by Ann Roy at Center for Intercultural Documentation (CIDOC) in Cuernavaca, Mexico, possibly on Women in Mexico. Ann Roy tells an extended story about two young sisters she knew in Marfil, Guanajuato, Mexico in the 1960s - Bola and Concha - who both became pregnant before marriage. She describes it as an illustration of how little women are taught about sex and conception in Mexican village culture. Students ask questions and interject with their own thoughts and experiences, sometimes overlapping. Discussions include Mexican customs of chaperoned courtship and marriage agreeements between families, the difference between civil and religious marriage, Mexican compulsory military service, stigmas of divorce and single motherhood, and the strictness of Mexican and Cuban families. In the last clip, Ann Roy talks about perceptions of men and women in Mexican culture, machismo, women who kill their husbands, a lack of rehabilitation services for women in prison, and Aztec culture as one of the first patriarchal cultures.  Recording starts and ends in progress.","00:00 Ann talks about “robada” or “to steal” and relates the term with a situation where parents will not give a young couple permission to marry. Ann continues to explain that in village culture, when a young woman leaves church in the evening she does not go back home with her parents, but either sleeps outside or stays with a relative related to the man. Ultimately, the woman is not allowed to be received back by her parents until she marries; however, Ann explains that the situation is complicated because the woman’s parents are not allowed to agree immediately to marriage or else people might think there is something wrong with the girl, yet the girl must sleep outside until her parents agree to a marriage; 03:00 Ann tells a story about a young couple she knew. The girl, Bola was secretly staying with a boy, Louis, in his room. The mother knew about it and did not say anything while the father was unaware of the situation. After nine months of hiding the girl she became pregnant and Arturo freaked out, blamed the girl, and attempted to give the baby away. Bola did not agree to give the baby away. When the girl was seven months pregnant, Bola and her sister, Concha met two boys from out of town and they walked with the girls in the evening. Louis became jealous and wanted to marry her immediately after disregarding her and the pregnancy; 15:00 The girl marries the other boy instead and did not care about the advice of other people in the village; 15:50 Ann tells the story of another couple, Concha and Jaunito. Concha also becomes pregnant and she had no idea when or how it happened. Ann talks about practicing natural childbirth with Concha and how successful it was; 24:10 Ann talks about going to Tulsa with both Concha and Bola for two months and both the girls are confused and worried about being pregnant again since they have not received their periods. Ann talks about Bola’s husband and how scary it was for him to ask her parents if he could marry her; 29:30 Another woman in the room tells a story about another couple that wanted to get married and the parents refused. The girl ended up getting married and the parents do not know; 31:50 [Cataloger’s note: recording becomes quieter and harder to understand]. Ann offers suggestions to make marriage easier; 36:40 Ann tells a story about her friend, Christina; 47:45 Ann talks about a societal pattern in Mexico regarding the male and female and mentions how the female side is identified with the [Inca?] as losers and the male side is identified with the conquistador as the winners. Ann tells a story about a young man who was close-minded and macho. She continues to say that as a female you are supposed to be passive, open, and will-less versus men who must be aggressive and closed; 55:00 Ann talks about equality between men and women in pre-Columbian civilizations and the value the different functions men and women performed for the civilization as a whole; 58:10 Ann notes that the first big change between preexisting patterns between males and females occurred with the Aztec civilization as they became a male dominated society.","Segement sequence","Marriage customs and rites","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1010592","Illegitimate children","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/967203","Arranged marriage","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/815057","Women--Social conditions","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1176947","Sex instruction for girls","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/1114531","Concha","local","Bola","local","","","Marfil (Guanajuato, Mexico, North and Central America) (inhabited place)","http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7379051","","","","","","","","","","","narv_royAnn_34-05_annStorytelling_a.mp3","University of Colorado Boulder Libraries Rare and Distinctive Collections","COU:1397","","","","","","","2021","audio/mp3","local","reformatted digital","This Item is protected by copyright and/or related rights.

Three women pose on a chaise lounge in a living room, one as a lion with a mirrored sun on her forehead, Ann Roy in a snake skinned suit, and a woman in black, sometimes veiled, holding a jeweled sword. They hold up mirrors and peacock feathers. Reel also includes footage of the woman preparing their shots and costumes, and pans across artwork and decorative objects in the room, some by artist William Rabon. Later, they are joined by two men and two boys. In the end, Ann Roy holds up a hand mirror to reveal the camera operator, and a toilet flushes.","00:00 Camera pans around a room showing various knickknacks on a shelf and the walls such as a peacock feather, candelabras, and posters; 00:50 A girl dressed as a lion smiles into the camera.
